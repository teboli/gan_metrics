# gan metrics

This repository has been made to bring some quantitative metrics to help evaluating images producing with GANs. It contains pytorch code for the Inception score [1] and the FCN score [2].

The inception network is the one of torchvision and comes with pretrained weights in ImageNet dataset. The FCN network is pretrained on Pascal VOC 2012 dataset. Feel free to retrain one or another network on your own dataset as done in [2].

The FCN score code is heavily adapted from the FCN pytorch implementation of wkentaro: https://github.com/wkentaro/pytorch-fcn.

## Requirements

- [pytorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) >= 0.4.1
- [torchvision](https://github.com/pytorch/vision) >= 0.2.1
